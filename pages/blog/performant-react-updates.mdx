Over the holidays I've been playing around with [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) working on a [sticky note clone](https://mixed-berry.vercel.app/),
it's been pretty fun as it's a different paradigm than I'm used to mixing both 3d canvas and <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> elements to produce a hybrid of both worlds while still using React to tie it all together.
One of the first features I worked on was re-creating focus state inside canvas as it doesn't exist natively,
the requirements were similar to how focus state works in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> where only one element can be focused at a time for example when clicking on a sticky note it should become focused and the previously focused sticky note should become unfocused.

# The first pass

So we need to remember this is a side project and I'm just going in hard no tests guns blazing.
So obviously I'll just slap everything into state,
duh!
